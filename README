1. Setup
Keep the file and folder structure as is. You may need to install pygame (can be found online).

2. Running the program
In the same folder use the command "python genetic.py", i.e. run genetic.py.

2.1 Training with genetic algorithm
Uncomment lines 177-180, and comment all of the other lines below it. There are a few parameters to the "beginEvolution" function. 
- seedAI: represents the initial generation of AI
- number of generations: number of iterations to perform the genetic algorithm
- numThreads: used for multithreading. May not actually improve runtime.
- lineLimit: impose a line limit 

2.2 Running AI that runs practically indefinitely
Uncomment line 183 (keeping all other active lines commented).

2.3 Running AI that "tetrises" often
Uncomment line 186 (keeping all other active lines commented).
